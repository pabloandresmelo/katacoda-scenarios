El **Online DevOps Dojo** tiene varios personajes que participas a lo largo de los modulos. Aquí están sus biografias. Conoce sus desafios y sueños para que puedas compartir sus logros a medida que se desarrolla nuestra historia.

### Charlie (CEO)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/charlie.png)

**C**harlie es **C**EO de la compañia; un empresario tecnológico, inversor
y filántropo.

Charlie tiene la intención de impactar el mundo de las clínicas para mascotas y considera que DevOps es la clave
para los planes de la compañía.

### Chun (Coach)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/chun.png)

**C**hun es un **c**oach, facilitadora del cambio y tecnóloga. Ha estado ayudando a las organizaciones a hacer la transición de
de las prácticas tradicionales de desarrollo a las prácticas y la cultura de DevOps, con el apoyo de herramientas y procesos para aumentar la frecuencia y calidad del software.

Ella creció en el papel de DevOps coach. El coaching de Chun se basa en su experiencia adquirida al trabajar en startups y
empresas multinacionales. En sus funciones anteriores era una persona ávida de actividades al aire libre y adicta a la adrenalina, amante de la diversión, odiaba estar
de estar de guardia, y trabajó extensamente para automatizar al máximo los procesos de construcción, pruebas, empaquetado y despliegue para asegurar que los
sistemas fueran creados con un modelo LessOps (menos operaciones) en mente.

Tras identificar las oportunidades que ofrece DevOps, decidió dar un paso adelante y entrenar a otros, para practicar lo que predica. Chun está
está comprometida con el crecimiento de la comunidad de coaching de DevOps, aprovechando su experiencia para apoyar / entrenar a otros.

### Brenda (Business)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/brenda.png)

**B**renda es de **b**usiness. Uno de sus objetivos es ayudar a que la empresa crezca. Cuanto más vende, más feliz se pone, y
clave para ello es la disponibilidad y funcionalidad de la aplicación Pet Clinic. Por supuesto, ella es consciente de la capacidad de ingeniería,
las limitaciones técnicas, la seguridad y todo eso, pero su objetivo principal es ofrecer constantemente
sus mascotas, junto con características que dejarán muy atrás a los competidores de Pet Clinic. Es competitiva, pero también ha desarrollado
empatía con el equipo. Está muy orgullosa de sus dos golden retrievers, Bonnie y Clyde.

Brenda trabaja principalmente con Paulo, el product owner. Ella le explica a Paulo lo que quiere, y Paulo ayuda al equipo a
priorizar el trabajo para que Brenda pueda incorporar a la aplicación lo que la empresa necesita.

Ella participa en las demostraciones del final de sprint, donde aprecia la oportunidad de interactuar con otros miembros del equipo. Entre
el sprint planning y el sprint review, Brenda siente que el equipo la involucra a menudo, a veces "demasiado". Le gustaría
contar más con Paulo.

Brenda escuchó una vez a Selma, el contacto de seguridad del equipo, cuando se hackeó información importante de un cliente. No fue una experiencia agradable
para ella, para la empresa y, desde luego, para los clientes. Rastrearon el ataque hasta un hacker llamado Hal, que ha estado
en comunicación con el equipo a través de un correo electrónico anónimo.

Brenda está dispuesta a llevar a Pet Clinic a nuevas áreas de crecimiento. Una reciente incursión en el mercado de productos para mascotas fue muy alentadora, así que
por lo tanto, está trabajando con Paulo para incluir historias y épicas en el backlog del equipo, de modo que las mejoras necesarias para la aplicación Pet Clinic estén listas a tiempo para el lanzamiento de marketing previsto en apoyo de estas nuevas líneas de productos.

### Paulo (Product Owner)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/paulo.png)

**P**aulo is the **P**roduct Owner, he is a cat person and volunteers at a local
animal rescue center.

Paulo works with Brenda to define the vision of the product. He prioritizes the
backlog with Santhosh the Scrum master and the Scrum team.

Passionate and outcome-driven he is a product owner with twenty years experience
in all aspects of product delivery. He has experience across multiple
industries, in addition to entrepreneurial experience having run his own company
in the past.

Sometimes, Paulo feels that Brenda does not really know what she wants and that
she changes her mind too quickly. "This is because of a rapidly changing
environment", Brenda says before uttering the magic words that expose the
Achilles heel of every product owner
- [Principle 2 of the Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) states:

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

To the bemusement of the team, Paulo replies that this is INCONCEIVABLE! :) and then works to facilitate the changes via the
backlog. After which the team points out to Paulo that he keeps using that word and that the team [doesn't think it means what he thinks it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D58LpHBnvsI).

As a key stakeholder in the Agile process, as part of his product owner responsibilities and from his interactions with Brenda, Paulo
has the vision of what is to be built, why it is to be built and in what order it is to be built. He conveys that vision to the
Scrum team who regularly and rather unfairly questions it in his opinion.

### Santhosh (Scrum Master)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/santhosh.png)

**S**anthosh is the **S**crum Master. He is the advisor to and facilitator for the agile development team. He helps everybody
including our cast (Brenda from the business, Paulo the product owner, Tina the tester and Dan the developer) understand Scrum
theory, practices, rules, and values.

Santhosh is keen to learn and understand DevOps tools and processes to better understand the nuances in the approach and
responsibilities of Scrum teams adopting DevOps and Scrum teams who are not adopting DevOps.

Traditional Scrum teams consist of people who deliver the potentially releasable increments at the end of a Sprint. Whereas Scrum
teams adapting DevOps target the whole value stream so the team includes all the people who work a Product Backlog Item (PBI) in the
end-to-end value stream. A DevOps Scrum team could include some or all of the following: analysts, UI/UX designers, developers,
operations people, sysadmins, data scientists and site reliability engineers. A DevOps Scrum team works together, collaboratively as
one unit, to deliver value to their customers.

Santhosh works diligently as a Scrum master to protect the team from anything -
typically requests originating from Brenda or Paulo that may distract them from
the active sprint deliverables - and to remove anything that impedes the flow of
value delivery from the team to the business.

### Adam (Site Reliability Engineer)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/adam.png)

**A**dam is a System **A**dministrator who is transitioning to the role of Site
Reliability Engineer (SRE). SRE is a discipline that combines software and
systems engineering to create ultra-scalable and massively distributed,
fault-tolerant systems.

As he transitions into the SRE role, Adam is keen to learn and understand best
practices in the SRE and DevOps fields so he can help shape the SRE culture in
the company. He has started to work with Brenda to understand the needs of the
business and with the Scrum team to ensure they have robust solutions in place
for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining their applications and their cloud
environments so they can meet the needs of their customers.

He also works closely with Selma the Security Officer to ensure the security of
the company's software and applications. Adam suspects that Hal may have an
inside man. Adam has a particular set of skills so he is working on a plan to
look for the hacker, to find the hacker, to ... the hacker.

Adam has a pet parrot whose favorite phrase is "Have you tried turning it off
and on again?" and is working with Brenda to expand the Bird, Reptile and Small
Animal product lines offered by Pet Clinic.

### Dan (Developer)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/dan.png)

**D**an, one of the Pet Clinic development team, is a full stack **D**eveloper originally from Mos Eisley. He has worked as a senior
developer for a number of years, most recently for First Order Inc., and has mentored new hires and interns in a number of the
companies he has worked in. He has a keen interest in learning and applying new technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, and new
programming paradigms using his weapons of choice PHP and Node.js on cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure to solve complex business
problems.

He is also keen to learn more about the practical applications of test-driven development, continuous integration and build
pipelines. When not jumping out of buses on Fortnite Battle Royale, he admits to a slight obsession learning about serverless
computing and microservices.

Dan's workmates still fondly recall the fun and games which ensued when Shelob, his pet tarantula, got lose in the Pet Clinic office
on *"Bring Your Pets to Work"* day.

Sometimes, Dan feels that Brenda expects too much, changes her mind too often, and does not pay enough attention to the quality of
the functionality being released. Dan works closely with Tina the tester; they regularly debate if a story has been implemented in a
way that meets the stated acceptance criteria and delivers value to the Pet Clinic application users.

### Tina (Tester)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/tina.png)

**T**ina is a **T**ester. Her motto, which she is apt to quote often, is "You can't test in quality; you have to build it into the
DNA of the software development process."

Tina worked until recently in a traditional testing role, where testing was performed after the development stage of the application
assembly line. She is aware that the role of and skills required by a tester are changing. Tina realizes that testers have to become
comfortable working with code and be able to analyze it. She appreciates that testers need to work within the Scrum teams in order
to ensure quality is built into the software development process during the two week sprint cycle.

She is keen to expand her strong testing skills, to become more technically adept, and to learn more about coding so she can start
working on test automation. By expanding her skills to become a test automation expert she hopes to play a more active role in the
sprint cycle.

In her spare time, aside from finding and documenting bugs in Dan the Developer's code, she enjoys hiking near the Reichenbach
Falls. She thinks the advent of the cloud is the greatest thing to hit the testing world in years, if only because it prevents
developers like Dan from saying "it is working on my machine".

Like Paulo she volunteers at the animal rescue center and helps run the Pet Clinic community engagement project that supports that
shelter.

### Selma (Security)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/selma.png)

**S**elma is the company's **S**ecurity Officer, and is the proud owner of a German Shepherd called Arnold. Selma is currently under
pressure due to the sudden spike in security vulnerabilities being identified as a result of Hal the hacker's efforts.

Rather than considering the SecOps aspect of DevOps as an afterthought, Selma wants the team to keep security in mind in everything
they do by:

- Building security into the applications.
- Protecting applications and data within the DevOps automation chain.

Whilst admittedly distracted by the cat and mouse game she is currently engaged with Hal the hacker on, Selma is more than mindful
of the fact that security approaches and technologies must be systemic to the applications’ data handling, transportation and
storage mechanisms. Selma is working with Paulo the product owner to ensure security stories, tasks and acceptance criteria are
incorporated and prioritized in the product backlog.

She is troubled by Paulo's apparent lack of concern of the potential ramifications of the recent hack, but does appreciate his help
creating stories to address the vulnerabilities exposed. She also wishes he would stop his recent and rather annoying habit of
humming the theme tune to Mission Impossible when discussing how to best address the potential for negative publicity around the
hack.

### Hal (Hacker)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/hal.png)

**H**al is a white hat **H**acker, engaged by the company to find and expose vulnerabilities in the company's applications. A
vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a Threat Actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a
computer system. Hal's job is to find those vulnerabilities before the bad guys do, so stories can be created to close them and
worked into the Development backlog with the assistance of Paulo the product owner.

Hal, upon learning that Aristotle was not Belgian and that the London Underground was not a political movement, was struck with a
passion to seek out information wherever it may be. Hal is sure that the truth is out there. After a number of close encounters with
the legal institutions of the state and some volunteer work in the community, this passion for information has over time
transitioned into a well paying gig as a White Hat Hacker. Hal helps companies to help themselves.

Paulo the product owner is aware of Hal the hackers secret identity but has been sworn to secrecy by Charlie. The rest of the team
meanwhile whilst slightly puzzled by the volume of security stories Paulo has recently started creating, are nonetheless very
impressed with Paulo's savant like knowledge of security which he attributes to an online security course he recently took.

Hal, tired of people asking him to open the pod bay doors, has been trying to get people to call him by the code name Neo instead.
But most people still call him Hal.

Hal has no pets due to a wide range of allergies.
